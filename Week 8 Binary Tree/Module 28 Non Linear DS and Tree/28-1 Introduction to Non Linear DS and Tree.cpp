        Data Structure tree:

        Non Linear DS =  Which Data arrange is not contiguous formate. another Is which data is arranged like branch or tree is called NOn linear data structure.

        Data structure Tree = In computer science, a tree is a widely used
        abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with
        a set of connected nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many
        children, but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the
        root node, which has no parent.

        Parents = Parents of DS tree is a root node which has at most two child.

        Root node = which node has no parent is called Root node of a data structure tree.

        child = which node has their parents node is called child and they have two child and left and right.

        Every node has no cycle .



        Binary Tree =

        A binary tree is one of the most extensively used
        tree data structures. It is a hierarchical data structure wherein
        each node has two children, the left child and the right child.
        A typical binary tree consists of
        the following components: Ø A root node. Ø A left subtree.
