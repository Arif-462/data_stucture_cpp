     its have another operation like that size,etc.

     Queue operation er jonno duita point maintain korte hoy.
     like that start and end point for index maintain.

     initially start and end point is 0.

     when we insert a value to queue the end pointer increase by one
     when we insert another value to queue end pointer increase by another onde.

     For this rule between start and end is callled queue.

     When we delete any value from a queue the start pointer will be move to right and delete the front value and continue
     this procees for delete value.

     when is start is greater than end point we can say the queue is empty.


     when we perform front operation just print the start value of queue
    For getting size of queue rule is = end - start +1
