   Which thinks to Judge: Algorithm Judge muloto dui vabe  judge kora hoy
        1. Time basis judge
        2. Space Bsis judge

    How to Judge :
        1. bar bar run > kore judge korte hobe.(bad way)
        2. Before run > think to judge like, how many time take and how many spaces needs. its also called complexity.

    coplexity analysis :
                example,
        input two numbers;
        add two numbers;
        print result;
    this thinks are constant oparation;
        In which code variable is constant or variable does not input from user is called constant operation.

    Variable Operation : user theke j input nea hoy and execution pore result print kora hoy thake Variable Operation.
            Example,
            input n; (This is user input)
            add n numbers;
            print result;

    Time complexity : Time complexity prokash korar jonno 3 ta nottation bebohar korte hoy;
            Example,
            O(Complexity)=upperbound koto=Big O nottetion = Upper Bound operation= O(1)=simple operation = constant operation.
            Omega(Complexity)=Lower bound koto=Omega nottetion=Lower Bound operation=
            Theta(Complexity)= Theta nottetion= Upper and Lower bound koto

    O(Complexity) or Big O nottetion e beshi bebohar kora hoy.
            Example,
            O(1)=Algorithms constant opperation kore=Without LOOp Operation;
            others,

            polymial algorithms:
             O(n)=Order of n operation=User input operation;
             O(n^2)=Order of n square operation;
             O(n^3)=
             O(n^k)=
             O(log n)=
             O(nlog n)=
             O(n root n)=

             Exponential algorithms;
